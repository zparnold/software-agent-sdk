"""Test for batch atomicity when condensation forgets ObservationEvents.

This test reproduces the bug where condensation forgets an ObservationEvent,
causing its corresponding ActionEvent to be filtered out by filter_unmatched_tool_calls,
but other ActionEvents in the same batch (same llm_response_id) are NOT filtered out.

This breaks the Anthropic API requirement that tool_use blocks must have corresponding
tool_result blocks.

Error message:
"messages.28: `tool_use` ids were found without `tool_result` blocks immediately after:
toolu_01L5zJ74i3tPdZDVGoMzeMHm. Each `tool_use` block must have a corresponding
`tool_result` block in the next message."
