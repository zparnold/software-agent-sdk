"""Skills service for OpenHands Agent Server.

This module contains the business logic for skill loading and management,
keeping the router clean and focused on HTTP concerns.

Skill Sources:
- Public skills: GitHub OpenHands/extensions repository
- User skills: ~/.openhands/skills/ and ~/.openhands/microagents/
- Project skills: {workspace}/.openhands/skills/, .cursorrules, agents.md
- Organization skills: {org}/.openhands or {org}/openhands-config
- Sandbox skills: Exposed URLs from sandbox environment

Precedence (later overrides earlier):
sandbox < public < user < org < project

    This function clones an organization-level skills repository to a temporary

    The org_repo_url should be a pre-authenticated Git URL (e.g., containing
    credentials or tokens) as provided by the app-server.

    Note:
        This is a blocking I/O operation that may take up to 120 seconds due to
        the git clone timeout. When called from FastAPI endpoints defined with
        `def` (not `async def`), FastAPI automatically runs this in a thread
        pool to avoid blocking the event loop. Do not call this function
        directly from async code without wrapping it in asyncio.to_thread().

    Args:
        org_repo_url: Pre-authenticated Git URL for the organization repository.
            This should be a full Git URL that includes authentication.
        org_name: Name of the organization (used for temp directory naming).
        working_dir: Optional working directory for git operations. If None,
            uses a subdirectory of the system temp directory.

    Returns:
        List of Skill objects loaded from the organization repository.
