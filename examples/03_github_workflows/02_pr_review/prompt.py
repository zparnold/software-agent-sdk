PR Review Prompt Template

This module contains the prompt template used by the OpenHands agent
for conducting pull request reviews.

The template uses skill triggers:
- {skill_trigger} will be replaced with '/codereview' or '/codereview-roasted'
- /github-pr-review provides instructions for posting review comments via GitHub API

The template includes:
- {diff} - The complete git diff for the PR (may be truncated for large files)
- {pr_number} - The PR number
- {commit_id} - The HEAD commit SHA
- {review_context} - Previous review comments and thread resolution status
"""

# Template for when there is review context available
_REVIEW_CONTEXT_SECTION = """
## Previous Review History

The following shows previous reviews and review threads on this PR. Pay attention to:
- **Unresolved threads**: These issues may still need to be addressed
- **Resolved threads**: These provide context on what was already discussed
- **Previous review decisions**: See what other reviewers have said

{review_context}

When reviewing, consider:
1. Don't repeat comments that have already been made and are still relevant
2. If an issue is still unresolved in the code, you may reference it
3. If resolved, don't bring it up unless the fix introduced new problems
4. Focus on NEW issues in the current diff that haven't been discussed yet
